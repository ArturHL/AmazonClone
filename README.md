# AmazonClone
This project is a copy of the navigation bar of the amazon.com website.
The interesting thing in this project is that it was built with HTML-PugJS, CSS-Less and Vanilla Javascript for DOM handling. 
All files are located in the src folder.
Personally I don't think to update this project anymore, however, the main file (template.html) was thought to create the different amazon pages (categories, promotions, etc.) and to be used as a base template on which future functionalities would be built.
It has no backend connection and does not consume any API.
